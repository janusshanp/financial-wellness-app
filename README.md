### About:

PiggyPay is a group project which was built during the General Assembly Financial Wellness Hackathon.\
&nbsp;\
This application was designed so that children in the age group of 4-12 can learn about financial literacy in a fun and interactive way. We believed that financial literacy is still a taboo topic for many parents and since it is not taught well in school this app would be a great place for kids to learn about these skills to ensure they do not grow up financially illliterate.\
&nbsp;\
PiggyPay was created by six students: Janusshan Paramasivam (Dev), Ryan Joseph(Dev), Kevin Glen(Dev), Kimberly Fajardo(UXDI), Nhi Tran(UXDI) and Zana Hasaj(UXDI). This project was completed within a span of 4 days to meet the hackathons requirements.\

### Key Learning:

- React is a very powerful and dynamic tool, but we have to do it "The React Way".
- In React, state and props management is important.
- Component management is the key.
- Learn to create a MVP product within a tight deadline

---

### Challenges:

- Creating a fully functional app in a small amount of time takes a lot of effort.
- The newest version of React and React Router required to use functional component for many features, and it makes class based component difficult to work with
